This is a sample input file for testing the word_counter.py application. This file contains several lines of text with words and punctuation.

Let's add some more words to make it interesting. More words mean a better test scenario. It's important to check if the application handles various cases, including uppercase and special characters!

Now, let's repeat some words to see how the application counts occurrences. Word counter, are you up for the challenge?

This is the end of the sample input file. Thank you for using word_counter.py!
